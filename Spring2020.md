# Spring 2020: Modeling ice shell convection

**Course overview**

The course introduces geoscientists to numerical solution of dynamical problems arising in the solid earth geosciences. The students will develop their own codes in Matlab and apply them to gain insight into heat transfer, wave propagation, elastic and viscous deformations. Familiarity with Matlab is assumed, for an introduction to Matlab please attend GEO 325G.

**Course websites:**

* Course discussion forum is on Piazza, see tab in menu on the left.
* Homeworks will be completed on Matlab Grader (Links to an external site.).

You should have received invitations to both sites, let me know if you didn't.

**Matlab background:**

Here are some LiveScripts I prepared for a previous class.
If you don't have much Matlab experience, please look through
them. Vectorized programming is a particularly important topic.

**Maths background**

Useful vector calculus refresher: [Div, Grad, Curl and all that](https://wwnorton.com/books/Div-Grad-Curl-and-All-That)
